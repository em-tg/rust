warning[E0596]: cannot borrow `self` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable

LL |         self.modify();
   |         ^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable

   = note: as `Self` may be unsized, this call attempts to take `&mut &mut self`
   = note: however, `&mut self` expands to `self: &mut Self`, therefore `self` cannot be borrowed mutably
   = note: `#[warn(mut_non_mut)]` on by default
